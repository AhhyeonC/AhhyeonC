Hi, I'm Ahhyeo Cho. 
I have been studying in Climate Analysis and Modeling Laboratory (CAM Lab) in Gwangju Institude of Science and Technology (GIST), Korea.

I am interested in Climate Change, especially about extreme events.

I am uploading some practical codes for processing climate-related data (from basic-level to professional-level).  
Uploading is on going, and other codes will be uploaded soon.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to e-mail me!
